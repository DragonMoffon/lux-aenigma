# This file contains the data used to determine the order that levels are completed
# The UserPack list of tables allows the user to collate a set of levels to share
# with friends (steam workshop????)
# This file does not actually store the save data for a player
# User levels are stored independent of save

# The hope is to eventually hook into the steam api so user levels have the player_id suffix to protect against
# name clashes.

# Each list becomes an option in the level select menu with packs getting their own sub select screen.

# Also yes this technically means a player can change the story levels, but if they do I will disable achievements.
